> Rotterdam-based photographer Ari Versluis and profiler Ellie
> Uyttenbroek have worked together since October 1994. Inspired by a
> shared interest in the striking dress codes of various social
> groups, they have systematically documented numerous identities
> over the last 14 years. Rotterdam's heterogeneous, multicultural
> street scene remains a major source of inspiration for Ari Versluis
> and Ellie Uyttenbroek, although since 1998 they have also worked in
> cities abroad.

"Our dreams are their worst nightmares, these songs a call to arms.
We can dance on the graves that held us, we can change the course
of Time. Stand up and fight, save yourself, Strike, the time is
now! You and me, we are more like sheep, forced to march crippled
feet to the slaughter. I'll stand on principle, banner lifted and a
fist raised high. Filthy soul with a patriot heart, dancing rhythms
in a world apart." So ein geiler Song...

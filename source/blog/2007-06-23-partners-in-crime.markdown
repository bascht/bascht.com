Was für ein geiler Song...

 
> Can't get back to the way we were Nothing else mattered It was us
> against the world It was us against the world Always us against the
> world Now it's just me sucking in that summer air What a summer, i
> had no care How quick it all crashed down Not willing to bend,
> bend, bend And these struggles changed us It's best to admit that
> to yourself Stuck trapped in memories The tragic tale of you and me
> Can't get back to the way we were Nothing else mattered It was us
> against the world

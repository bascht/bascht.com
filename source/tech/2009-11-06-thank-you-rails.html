title: Thank you, Rails

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<p>This is all pretty understandable: it’s easy to define community in terms of
what we’re <em>not</em>. A common enemy focuses and drives us. Competition can take a
positive form: when it’s friendly and constructive both communities benefit.</p>
<p>Lately, though, I’ve noticed the tone of the arguments in the Django community
getting nastier — especially when it comes to Rails. Again, I’m far from
innocent in this regard: I’ve certainly done my fair share of Rails-bashing,
and I regret it.</p>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">
<p>According to the proposal, any company doing business in the States could not create an encrypted communication system without having a way for the government to order the company to decrypt it, and those who currently do offer that service would have to retool it. It's the equivalent of outlawing whispering in real life.  </p>
<p>Cryptographers have long argued that backdoors aren't a featureâ€”they are just a security hole that will inevitably be abused by hackers or adversarial governments.                     </p>

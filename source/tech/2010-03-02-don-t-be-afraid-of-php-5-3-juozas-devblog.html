      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">While attending <a href="http://www.phpconference.co.uk/">PHPUK conference</a> in London, I noticed how much talk there is about PHP 5.3 and “when to upgrade?”, there was even a presentation about that. Because I have been using PHP 5.3 for more than half a year, I decided to share my views on this topic. This topic is very important as the earlier PHP 5.3 is adopted, the sooner second iteration of frameworks can be released</blockquote>

title: Spamassassin FH_DATE_PAST_20XX test buggy in 2010

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">It seems there is an issue with the <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">Spamassassin</a> <strong>FH_DATE_PAST_20XX</strong> test. This test checks whether the email has a date in the future and, if this is the case, raises the messageâ€™s score. Apparently, this test is falsely triggered by all emails that have been sent in 2010, producing several <em>false positives</em>.</blockquote>

    <p>Due to a bug in the Spamassassin ruleset a lot of messages fail the FH_DATE_PAST_20XX check 'cause they are sent in 2010(!). <br>The resolution is quite handy: just run sa-update.</p>

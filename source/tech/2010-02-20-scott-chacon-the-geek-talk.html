<p>At GitHub we don’t have a project tracker or todo list – we just all work on whatever is most interesting to us.  No standup meetings, burndown charts or points to assign. No chickens or pigs.  It’s sort of the open source software style of business – everyone itches thier own scratch.  Inexplicably, it works really well and keeps everyone engaged, new features appearing quickly and bugs fixed rather fast. No managers, directors, PMs or departments – and it’s the most agile, focused and efficient team I’ve ever worked with.  Maybe we should write a book about it.</p>

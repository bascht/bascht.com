title: Say Something Nice About Every Language You’ve Used
---
<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">In Michael Easter’s <a href="http://codetojoy.blogspot.com/2010/11/language-panel.html">recent post</a>, I was struck by his comment that Guy Steele like <strong>all</strong> languages. Seems like a pretty chill way to live a programming career. So I wondered, do I like all languages? Can I say something nice about every language I’ve used? As the saying goes, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGt9jAkWie4">“If you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothin’ at all.”</a>

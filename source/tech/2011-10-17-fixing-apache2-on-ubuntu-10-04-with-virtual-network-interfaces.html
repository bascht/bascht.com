title: Fixing apache2 on Ubuntu 10.04
---
<p>Everything went well after upgrading my Ubuntu LTS installation to 10.04 LTS until I noticed that apache and lighttpd won't come up after a system reboot.</p>
<p>I thought it might be a small hickup with the upstart-migration.</p>
<p>Well, turns out it wasn't: In /var/log/boot.log i have found</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">Cannot assign requested address: make_sock: could not bind to address</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Ubuntu wouldn't bring up my <em>virtual</em> network interfaces on timeâ€¦<br>Gladfully someone else <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1623461.html">had this problem before</a>.</p>

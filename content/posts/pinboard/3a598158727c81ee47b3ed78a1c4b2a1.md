  "text": "The moment we are seeing now in software operations seems to be a type of high modernism. High modernism is a phenomenon that came about during the Cold War, characterized by a faith in scientific management and development, and a rejection of crafts and traditions. It was a vision of a well-ordered utopia, in the form of high rise living, in planned cities with simple geometries.\r\n\r\nLike high modernism, software high modernism is experiencing mixed success. Kubernetes is as divisive as ever Le Corbusier’s high rise buildings were. Switching a large organisation’s suite of microservices to a service mesh is almost as messy and disruptive as imposing a grid system on a medieval city (and done for much the same reasons of increasing legibility and hygiene). SLOs are useful, but defining meaningful non-cookie-cutter SLOs is a lot of work.",

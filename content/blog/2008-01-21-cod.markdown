    Bit Commitment Blues
    by Mike StayYou think I got zero knowledge,
    But I know you done me wrong.
    Just commit to me baby,
    So's I can sing a happier song!
    One bit of commitment,
    That's all I really need,
    So send me your hashed answer
    And the random seed.
    
    I got the bit commitment, bit commitment blues.
    I got the (thump thump hmmm...) bit commitment blues.
    
    I ain't oblivious, darlin',
    And honey, I ain't blind.
    Don't need sublim'nal channels
    To read your cheatin' mind.
    I'll share a secret with you:
    I know you hand out a public key.
    But why's it to the apartment
    
    That you're sharin' with me?
    
    I got the bit commitment, bit commitment blues.
    I got the (thump thump hmmm...) bit commitment blues.
    
    You say you love me, baby,
    But you flirt with other guys.
    You say you want me, honey,
    But I see you wink your eye.
    You say you need me, Alice,
    Now forgive me if I sob;
    You know my name is Charlie,
    So quit hangin' out with Bob!
    
    I got the bit commitment, bit commitment blues.
    
    I got the (thump thump hmmm...) bit commitment blues.

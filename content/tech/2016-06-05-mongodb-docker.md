Sometimes it's the little things in life. For example trying to
connect to a MongoDB instance over and over again, without getting
attached to a proper shell.

```bash
$ docker run --rm --net=host mongo mongo mydb
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.7
connecting to: mydb
bye
```

So, before you end up like me â€“ debugging things on the server side:
Check your docker parameters. You might be missing a `-ti` argument to
receive an interactive shell.

``` bash
$ docker run --rm -ti --net=host mongo mongo mydb
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.7
connecting to: mydb
type "help" for help
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
For interactive help, type "help".

Well. Bummer.

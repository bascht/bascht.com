Stumbled upon [https://forestry.io/](https://forestry.io/ "https://forestry.io/") and this looks like a neat way to update your static site on-the-go. It seems to be tailored towards Hugo and other SSGs and comes with support for front matter as well as section-specific templates.

I don't see a way to upload files to a custom endpoint though - only directly committing them to the repository, which is not what I want.

Just got a little Yubikey scare after accidentally inserting the same wrong PIN for 3 times, the password dialogue showing =0 retries= and even the =gpg --edit-card= command being unable to reset the pin:

#+BEGIN_SRC log
Error changing the PIN: PIN blocked
#+END_SRC

The [[https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013761339-Resetting-the-OpenPGP-Application-on-the-YubiKey][official docs]] make it sound like you'll have to hard reset your Yubikey, but this is not the case if you still have access to your admin pin:

Just use =ykman= to reset the counters:

#+begin_src bash
$ ykman openpgp access set-retries 3 3 3
Enter Admin PIN:
Set PIN retry counters to: 3 3 3? [y/N]: y
#+end_src

and we're good again:

#+begin_src bash
$ gpg --card-status | grep "PIN retry"
PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
#+end_src


Also unrelated, but - wow: I'm at =2535= signatures already.

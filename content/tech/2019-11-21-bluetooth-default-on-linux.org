#+TITLE:  Disabling Bluetooth on system boot in Fedora

If you're running Fedora Linux without any desktop environment it's probably
good to take a look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerTOP][=powertop=]] from time to time. Normally I would have GNOME
or KDE manage Bluetooth for me, but as I'm currently experimenting with Sway,
started straight from a tty, I have to manage services myself.

Good thing I checked, as the Bluetooth adapter was eating a whole Watt, while
essentially doing nothing but sending some useless beacons.

To disable the Bluetooth adapter right from the get go, check the config file in
=/etc/bluetooth=:

#+begin_src bash
grep AutoEnable /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
# AutoEnable defines option to enable all controllers when they are found.
AutoEnable=false
#+end_src

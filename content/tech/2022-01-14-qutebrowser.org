[[https://git.bascht.space/bascht/dotfiles/commit/c52f271bb19293d33f6f6101b214e1983c97c4cf][About two years ago]] I switched my main browser from Qutebrowser to Firefox. I
don't even remember what triggered the switch, but I was probably annoyed by
some glitches around the input / edit mode handling or needed to support 4
different proxies, so Foxproxy came in handy.

Yesterday I was [[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1749957][kindly reminded]] that it would be a good time to give
Qutebrowser another try. I no longer need to tunnel traffic through 4
different proxies on a daily basis. My custom CSS needs are modest (mono
fonts where possible) and gopass is supported well.

Sadly it's still not possible to have [[https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3636][per Domain CSS or JavaScript settings]],
but I can replicate most of my =user-styles.css= with generous application of
Greasemonkey.

So yesterday [[https://git.bascht.space/bascht/dotfiles/commit/fb9a138102693eacecda4e7ebd959b32222581e7][I switched back to Qutebrowser]] and there was almost no friction
in getting my day-to-day browsing done. (Granted, I was using [[https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl][Tridactyl]] with
Firefox)

What immediately felt like a relief: /The key-bindings are much more
consistent than they *could be* with Tridactyl./ That's not even Tridactyl's
fault, but with Firefox locking down what Add-Ons can do, there were more
road blocks, where I had to reach for the mouse. Again - *that's not even a
net-negative for Firefox*, as it probably improved the overall
browser-security in regard to Add-Ons. But I like to

 - tinker with my software
 - configure it with simple git-trackable config files
 - integrate it with other text-based utilities (think [[wm-gh:][org-mode]], wl-paste or
   my [[wm-gh:][drop scripts]])

it's been getting harder and harder to get Firefox to do this consistently
across multiple machines.

As for me, I am now back to a [[https://git.bascht.space/bascht/dotfiles/src/branch/main/dot_config/private_qutebrowser/config.py][simple =config.py=]] file to configure my browser
and I couldn't be happier.

#+TITLE:  Direnvin combination with Passwordstore

I'm using the brilliant [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] utility to manage passwords and user accounts for
myself and across different shared teams. Often enough I'm working in projects
where different utilities like Packer or Terraform slurp up credentials from
environment variables. 

So, why not combine it with [[https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-autoenv][zsh-autoenv]] to automatically export secrets when
entering the directory?

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

  # .direnv
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY=$(pass aws/customer/credentials|tail -n1|cut -d " " -f 2)
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(pass aws/customer/credentials|head -n1)%                                                                                   

#+END_SRC

Just agree upon a shared directory structure and use it across the whole team.

Why didn't I think of this any earlier?

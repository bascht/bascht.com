<p>I installed my mamp stack via macports, so the normal GUI-tools of Mac OS won't let me toggle any services. Coming from the Linux / init world thats my bumbling approach to have a quick startup-script for Apache and MySQL: <code> #!/bin/bash
 if [ "$1" == "start" ];
 then  /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start&amp;
 /opt/local/bin/mysqld_safe5&amp;
 else
 /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop
 /opt/local/bin/mysqladmin5 -u root shutdown
 fi  </code></p>

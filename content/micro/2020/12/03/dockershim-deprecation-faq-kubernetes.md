&quot;Given the impact of this change, we are using an extended deprecation timeline. It will not be removed before Kubernetes 1.22, meaning the earliest release without dockershim would be 1.23 in late 2021. We will be working closely with vendors and other ecosystem groups to ensure a smooth transition and will evaluate things as the situation evolves.&quot;
